                    ### Is this contract vulnerable to any of Ether Leak, Block State Dependency, Integer underflow/overflow, Mishandled Exception, Reentrancy?
                        (Think step-by-step, write seeds that demonstrates the actual attack vector against this contract and only use contract ABI functions)
                        Do not call private/internal functions directly, when ETH is sent to the contract, use fallback functions that handle incoming funds.                
                        
                        pragma solidity ^0.4.23; contract Delta { address public c = 0xF85A2E95FA30d005F629cBe6c6d2887D979ffF2A; address public owner = 0x788c45dd60ae4dbe5055b5ac02384d5dc84677b0; address public owner2 = 0x0C6561edad2017c01579Fd346a58197ea01A0Cf3; uint public active = 1; uint public token_price = 10**18*1/1000; function() payable { tokens_buy(); } function tokens_buy() payable returns (bool) { require(active > 0); require(msg.value >= token_price); uint tokens_buy = msg.value*10**18/token_price; require(tokens_buy > 0); if(!c.call(bytes4(sha3("transferFrom(address,address,uint256)")),owner, msg.sender,tokens_buy)){ return false; } uint sum2 = msg.value * 3 / 10; owner2.send(sum2); return true; } function withdraw(uint256 _amount) onlyOwner returns (bool result) { uint256 balance; balance = this.balance; if(_amount > 0) balance = _amount; owner.send(balance); return true; } function change_token_price(uint256 _token_price) onlyOwner returns (bool result) { token_price = _token_price; return true; } function change_active(uint256 _active) onlyOwner returns (bool result) { active = _active; return true; } modifier onlyOwner() { if (msg.sender != owner) { throw; } _; } }                        
                

                    ### You have four sender contracts: SmartianAgent1, SmartianAgent2, SmartianAgent3, and SmartianAgent4. Use their names in the parameters that need an address and in From fields as needed.
                

                    ### Available Contract Functions (You must only use the functions in this list for Test Case Generation):

                    change_active(uint256) onlyOwner
withdraw(uint256) onlyOwner
tokens_buy() payable 
change_token_price(uint256) onlyOwner
fallback()
                

                    ### JSON Grammar for EVM Test Case

                    #### Root
                    - An array of `TestCase` objects.

                    #### TestCase
                    - **DeployTx**: An object representing the deployment transaction, using the constructor function.
                    - **Txs**: An array of transaction (`Tx`) objects.

                    #### DeployTx
                    - **From**: A string representing the deployer's name or address.
                    - **Value**: A string representing the amount of Ether sent with the transaction.
                    - **Function**: A string representing the constructor function name being called.
                    - **Params** (optional): An array representing the parameters passed to the constructor, if it exists.
                    - **Timestamp**: A string representing the timestamp of the transaction.
                    - **Blocknum**: A string representing the block number when the transaction was included.

                    #### Tx (Transaction)
                    - **From**: A string representing the sender's name.
                    - **Value**: A string representing the amount of Ether sent with the transaction, if function is payable.
                    - **Function**: A string representing the function name being called.
                    - **Params** (optional): An array representing the parameters passed to the function.
                    - Parameters can be nested arrays.
                    - **Timestamp**: A string representing the timestamp of the transaction.
                    - **Blocknum**: A string representing the block number when the transaction was included.

                    ### Notes
                    - Each `TestCase` contains a `DeployTx` object and an array of `Tx` objects.
                    - Each transaction (`Tx`) includes details such as sender (`From`), value (`Value`), function name (`Function`), optional parameters (`Params`), timestamp (`Timestamp`), and block number (`Blocknum`).
                    - Parameters (`Params`) can be nested arrays to accommodate functions requiring multiple lists of parameters.
                    - Do not call internal functions directly.
                    
                    ### Objective
                    Create 10 new test case objects, each containing more than 8 transactions that might uncover bugs in the contract.
                    Ensure the transactions use raw values and respect the data types in the function signatures and consider functions modifiers in your transactions.
                    Provide the response as RFC8259 compliant JSON without explanations.
